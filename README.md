# Upgrad DataScience Projects
All Data Science projects completed for PGPDS by Upgrad

##  1) Stock Market Analysis using SQL

**The dataset provided here has been extracted from the NSE website. The Stock price data provided is from 1-Jan-2015 to 31-July-2018 for six stocks Eicher Motors, Hero, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Infosys and TCS.Aim of analysis is to provide insights to buy or sell the stocks**

In this project Stock market analysis is done for the 6 stocks provided above using MYSQL.
The Steps for analysis are as follows:
* Seperate tables are created from csv files for the respective Companies.
* The tables are then merged to form the master dataset.
* Data Inspection,Cleaning and Data Preparation is done on the dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis is done on the dataset and moving averages are calculated for each stock.
* Short term moving average is calculated for 20 days and long term moving average is calculated for 50 days.
* Buy and sell signals are generated based on the moving averages.
* Final Result of the anlysis is produced in the form of PDF.


## 2) Uber Supply Demand Gap

**The data set used for analysis  data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle.The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation.**

In this project Supply Demand Gap is identified for Uber using EDA in both Python and Tableau.
The Steps for analysis are as follows:
* Load the dataset into a dataframe.
* Perform Data Inspection and  Data Cleaning on the dataframe.
* Exploratoratory Data Analysis is done on the dataframe.
* Plots are created to visualize the important attributes and how they contribute to the supply demand gap in Python as well as Tableau.
* Final Results and recommendations are provided in the form of PDF with self explanatory plots.
